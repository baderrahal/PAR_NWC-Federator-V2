# PreToolUse hook for Bash, PowerShell and Monitor. Reads the tool call off standard input
# and refuses git making a commit on main or master, and any push that lands on main or
# master from any branch. Every fix goes on its own fix-FNN branch and reaches main
# through a merged pull request. Exit 2 refuses the call and the line on standard error
# goes back to Claude.
#
# THE COMMAND IS JUDGED ONE GIT CALL AT A TIME. It is split where the shell splits it, on
# a newline, ;, &&, ||, | and &, outside quotes, and each git call is read on its own
# words, quotes joined the way the shell joins them. Per call:
#
#   commit, cherry-pick, revert, am, rebase, commit-tree   refused while on main
#   merge and pull                                         refused while on main, unless --ff-only
#   push                                                   refused when a refspec lands on main or
#                                                          master, or deletes it, or --all or
#                                                          --mirror, from any branch, and refused
#                                                          while on main unless it only deletes
#                                                          another branch
#
# "On main" starts as the branch checked out and follows a checkout or switch to main, or
# away from it, earlier in the same command, because the branch is read before it runs.
#
# F99 on 2026-09-27 added PowerShell and git.exe. The Phase 0 reviews then found the first
# versions judging the whole command at once, so a -d or a --ff-only anywhere in it excused
# a push or a merge anywhere in it, and a newline, a semicolon or a quote after main hid
# the word. Per call reading is the answer to all of them.
#
# WHAT IT CANNOT SEE, named on purpose because it reads words and is not a sandbox: git run
# from inside a script, git or its verb built at run time, with $(...), backticks or
# PowerShell such as git @('commit'), and a git alias such as ci for commit. And when this
# folder is not a git repository, or git cannot say which branch is out, it lets the call
# through, because there is no main here to protect.
#
# Starting a program costs about two seconds on Bader's machine, measured on 2026-09-27, so
# the call is read with read and matched with case first. A call that does not say git and
# a verb that could write leaves before anything is started. git status, git log and git
# diff start nothing.
