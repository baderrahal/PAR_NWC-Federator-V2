# Rules for Federator.Addin

The add-in is the only project that touches the Navisworks API, and it cannot be built
in the container, only on a machine with Navisworks Manage 2025 installed. Every change
to it is read twice before it is pushed and its proof is a run on the local machine,
written into steps/03_bader_next.md. Rules whose logic lives in Core are in core.md.
The reasons and the measurements behind every rule are in
docs/history/claude-md-history.md, kept whole.

## Rules the code holds

- Each building writes its NWF, NWD and Excel before the next building starts.
  A failure part way through keeps everything already written
- Never clear and rebuild an NWF that already exists. This is the one rule most
  likely to be helpfully undone by someone who does not know why it is here.
  An NWF holds pointers to the NWC files, not copies, so a model updated in place
  needs no rebuild. The clash results live inside that NWF and are the only record
  of what has been fixed. Rebuilding it resets every clash to New and loses every
  Active and Resolved. This tool runs weekly, so that is a week of review thrown
  away each time. Three cases per group:
    no NWF at the output path, build it, there is no history to lose
    NWF there and its file list matches the group, open it, do not clear, do not
      re-append, log OPENED
    NWF there and the file list differs, log CHANGED with the counts, then REBUILT
      naming every file added, moved and removed, read the saved tests, clear the
      document, append the scan in scan order, put the saved sets and tests back
      where the clear dropped them, and only then save the NWF over. Bader decided
      this on 2026-09-07, Q22, so the rule above holds for a matching NWF and a
      differing one is rebuilt rather than left alone
  The file list is read out of the opened NWF. No side file records what went in,
  because a side file can disagree with the NWF and the NWF is the record
- The file list is read from Model.FileName, never from Model.SourceFileName.
  FileName is the NWC, which is what the scan holds. SourceFileName is the
  container the NWC was published from, which on this project is a Revit file in
  Autodesk Docs such as
    Autodesk Docs://KSA_New Murabba/1104-PAR-100000-ZZZ-AR-MOD-003000.rvt
  That can never equal a scanned NWC path, so comparing on it reported CHANGED for
  22 of 22 groups on a run where nothing had changed, and because a CHANGED group is
  left alone entirely, no NWF was reused, no set was built and no test ran. Both
  names still go in the log whenever they disagree, which is what made this
  findable. The rule lives in Federator.Core.Rerun.ModelFileNames so it can be
  tested without Navisworks, which is why it went unnoticed in the first place
- If no test can resolve a set, say so and stop before creating anything. One line
  naming how many sets the document holds and how many the tests name. A run against
  a document holding zero sets once went ahead anyway and finished with 0 created and
  0 run. This is a guard, visible in the log and in the window, never a silent skip
- The Run button does the whole job for every ticked group, model side and clash
  together. With no XML picked, the tests saved in each group's NWF are run where they
  sit, and a group whose NWF holds none runs nothing and the log says so. The clash step
  does one of three things and the log names which, in the same words on the scanned run
  and on the open file run: tests from XML, tests saved in the document, or nothing. The
  rule lives in Federator.Core.Clash.ClashWork.SourceFor. Sets come from the XML and from
  nowhere else, so with no XML the sets in the document are left alone. The two buttons on
  the Clash step are for trying one open model by hand and are labelled as that. They
  are not steps in the run. Splitting one job across three presses is what let a user
  run clash against a document with no sets in it. Since F34 each button calls the one
  engine method the run calls per group, BuildSetsByHand and RunTestsByHand, so the SETS
  and CLASH lines in the log read the same whichever way the work was started, D4, and
  picking an XML runs HealthCheck on it, with the whole summary in the log under HEALTH
  and one sentence under the file in the window, D1
- Republishing the NWD happens in the Build and Open cases, and it is no longer a tick box. It was
  one, on by default, and a weekly run wanted it every time, so it is fixed on. That is the
  point of a rerun. The NWF pointers are unchanged, so reopening picks up whatever the NWC
  files now hold and the NWD is refreshed without the clash history being touched
- The clash test file is picked at run time, every run, and can be from any project.
  Nothing about any one file is written into the code, not names, not counts, not
  property internal names. Those appear in tests as sample data only. A file may hold
  sets, tests, or both, and all three are normal. There is one picker, because Bader's
  file holds both and two boxes meant picking the same file twice
- Per group the order is append, save the NWF, build the sets, create the tests, run
  them, save the NWF again, publish the NWD last. The sets, the tests and the results
  all live in the NWF, so an NWD published before the clash work ships without any of
  them. The NWD used to go first and that is what this ordering fixes. The second
  save only happens when the clash step actually put something into the document
- Nothing is created twice on a rerun. A clash test already in the document under the
  same name is left exactly as it is, because that is where its Active and Resolved
  clashes live, and a set already at its path is left alone too, because a second copy
  would leave two sets at one path and a locator resolving to whichever came first.
  Both are counted and reported as already there, separately from what was created
- A CHANGED group is REBUILT from the scan folder, keeping the tests saved inside it,
  and the rebuild comes BEFORE the units change and the clash step, so from there it is
  an opened group. It used to be left alone entirely, and on 2026-09-07 six groups had
  an NWF built from an older folder with fewer files, 1B06BC 4 of 5 with EL missing,
  1B06K1 1 of 4, so the NWDs went out missing models and nothing rebuilt the NWF. The
  plan lives in Federator.Core.Rerun.NwfRebuildPlan: a file on both sides under a
  different folder is a MOVE, a file only in the scan is an addition, a file only in
  the NWF is a removal, and the files to append are the scan in scan order. The log
  carries one shape, REBUILT with the three counts, one line per file, then one saved
  tests line with three numbers read off the document: how many were read before the
  clear, how many were there after the appends, how many after the copy was put back.
  The copy is DocumentClashTests.CreateCopy and CopyFrom for the tests and the same
  pair on DocumentSelectionSets for the sets, the sets first because a side points at
  a set. The sets are counted by walking the tree, before the clear, after the appends
  and after the copy is put back, and put back on their own count whether or not the
  tests dropped, on one SETS line with the three numbers. Whether Document.Clear keeps
  either is UNKNOWN until a run, so the numbers are read and never assumed. The NWF on disk is only saved over once every test read before
  the clear is back, and otherwise the group fails, says so, and the NWF keeps its file
  list and its tests. A rebuilt group ends as Rebuilt and is judged DONE when everything
  after the rebuild went right, in Federator.Core.Rerun.GroupJudgement. Q22
- Applying the file's settings to a test already in the document is a tick box, off by
  default, and it says plainly that changing a test RESETS its results and every clash
  in it goes back to New. That is the whole reason the default is to report and not to
  act. What drifted is worth knowing every week. Overwriting it is worth doing once
- There is no stale marker on the clash API. Nothing named stale, altered, out of date,
  dirty or needs rerun exists on any type in Autodesk.Navisworks.Clash, public or
  private, measured on 2026-08-31, see docs\history\scan.md section 4j. The only thing there is
  ClashTest.Status, a four value enum of New, Old, Partial and Complete. What puts a test
  into Old is UNKNOWN and cannot be read off the DLL, so the status is logged as itself
  and no sentence is put on it. Never translate Old into "your models have changed". The
  Status setter is public and nothing here writes it, because writing it would be
  claiming to know the rule that is UNKNOWN
- Compact is reachable, DocumentClashTests.TestsCompactAllTests is public, and it is a
  tick box off by default that runs after the tests and before the workbook is written.
  Never compact silently. It removes every Resolved clash from the NWF, the NWF is the
  only record of what has been fixed, and there is no second copy anywhere, so it cannot
  be undone. The count is announced before it runs and the count removed is reported
  after. The no argument form is used, because TestsCompactTest takes a ClashTest and is
  a mutator, so the handle passed to it dies the way section 4g describes
- A clash side is pointed at the saved set through CreateSelectionSource, not filled
  with a copy of the set's items. That is what Clash Detective does when a person
  picks a set in the panel, and it is what keeps the counts matching the panel. A
  copy is a snapshot that can drift from the set the panel shows
- Everything that threw for one group is kept in a list, never in one slot. The model
  side can append cleanly and the clash step still throw, and one slot kept whichever
  wrote to it last and silently lost the other
- A handle onto anything the document owns is borrowed, never kept. Every SavedItem read
  out of a collection is created with eEXTERNAL ownership over a weak reference, so it
  dies the moment the document replaces the object behind it, and every mutator on
  DocumentClashTests is a copy form that does exactly that. TestsRunTest is one of them,
  so the test handed to it is dead when it returns and reading Children off it throws
  ObjectDisposedException (WeakRef). A test is addressed by where it sits, resolved again
  before every use, and disposed after. One run threw that exception once per test for
  8 hours 52 minutes and produced nothing
- Nothing walks a whole collection once per item. Looking a test up by name after every
  add was O(n squared) over 1830 tests and built about 1.7 million finalizable native
  handles per group. TestsAddCopy appends at the root, so the new test is at the index the
  count held before the add, checked by name rather than assumed
- What this tool creates or resolves, it disposes. All of ClashTest, ClashResult,
  ClashSelection, SelectionSet, SelectionSource, Selection, ModelItemCollection, Search
  and SavedItem are IDisposable. Disposing an eEXTERNAL wrapper releases the wrapper and
  never the document's object. SavedItemCollection is not disposable and is never disposed
- One picker, one file. The file can hold sets, tests, or both, and the tool reads what is
  in it. A file holding only tests still works against sets already in the model
- The naming boxes are filled from the patterns BEFORE anything can read them back.
  Filling the grouping combo sets SelectedIndex, which fires its handler, which regroups,
  which reads the boxes into the patterns. With the boxes still empty that replaced every
  default with nothing, and the window then opened with all fifteen naming boxes blank, so
  every field had to be typed by hand. That is where MOD-00001 came from instead of
  MOD-000001. The defaults were always six digits in the code and never reached the window
- A step whose content is taller than the window scrolls. Only the Outputs step is,
  measured at 1024x680, 1280x800 and 1600x1000 with tools\probes\probe-window-scroll.ps1 and
  cut off at all three, which is why the naming table could not be reached. The other three
  fit at all three sizes and are left alone, because a ScrollViewer around a step whose grid
  is meant to fill stops it filling
- The scan and its checks live in the Source step, so pressing Scan reports what was
  found and what is wrong with it in one place. A plain count line first, files found,
  files readable, groups and the findings by kind, then the findings themselves
- Copy findings puts them on the clipboard as tab separated rows with a header, so
  pasting into Excel gives a table. A run with nothing odd still copies a header and
  one row saying so, because an empty clipboard reads as a failed copy
- The add-in resolves its own assemblies from its bundle folder by simple name,
  ignoring the version, through an AssemblyResolve handler registered in the static
  constructor of FederatorPlugin. This is not belt and braces, it is the only thing
  that works. Six references bind to a version one build number away from the file
  that ships, .NET Framework binds a strong named assembly by exact version, and the
  binding redirects NuGet writes go in an application config that a Navisworks add-in
  does not have. Every file was already present when a run failed on this, so adding
  files fixes nothing. The rule lives in Federator.Core.Diagnostics.BundleAssemblies
  so it can be tested, and it is proved by a console exe with its config deleted, see
  docs\history\scan.md section 4i
- install.ps1 copies the bundle CONTENTS, never the bundle folder. Copy-Item of a
  directory puts it inside the destination when the destination exists and creates it
  when it does not, so the same line does two different things depending on whether
  the remove before it has finished. That left ParsonsNwcFederator.bundle inside
  ParsonsNwcFederator.bundle, which Navisworks does not read at all, and it is checked
  for afterwards
- install.ps1 walks what is actually in the bundle after copying and refuses to finish
  if any reference is satisfied by neither the bundle, the framework, nor the
  Navisworks folder. A missing file is caught at install rather than ninety seconds
  into a run. The version mismatches are printed too, labelled as expected, so nobody
  reads them as faults
- The NWF is looked at ONCE MORE after the NWD is published, because the NWD is published
  last and the NWF is the only record of what has been fixed. The line says intact and the
  size, or CHANGED with both sizes, or GONE. Nothing was checking this, so a run that did
  destroy the clash history would have finished quietly. It writes nothing and changes
  nothing, so it cannot itself break a group
- The Try forms return a bool and it is read, never discarded. For the NWD that
  bool is the only thing separating a fresh publish from last week's file at the
  same path, because File.Exists cannot tell them apart
- A property value is read by its KIND, never with ToDisplayString alone. Every accessor
  on VariantData is kind specific and throws on any other kind, and a Revit element id is
  an Int32, so ToDisplayString threw 426 times on one run and took the whole of Describe
  with it, losing the element id, the source file and the discipline together. The one
  member that returns a value regardless of kind is ToString, whose IL switches on
  GetDataType, but it prefixes the kind and hands back "Int32:702888". So the kind is read
  and the right accessor called, with ToString as the fallback for a kind nobody has seen
  and its prefix stripped. Measured, see docs\history\scan.md section 4n
- Anything that can throw per item goes in its own try. The source file and the discipline
  are read last and were lost to a throw three properties earlier, on all 426 items, which
  is one throw costing three columns
- Setting the models is still done, BEFORE the clash step, and it is kept because it fixes
  what the person sees in Navisworks. Measured on 2026-09-01 across all 4027 types:
  Document.Units is read only, Model.Units is read only, and the only public managed member
  that sets units at all is
  DocumentModels.SetModelUnitsAndTransform(Model, Units, Transform3D, bool). So each MODEL
  can be set and the DOCUMENT cannot. Whether Document.Units follows is UNKNOWN and no
  longer matters, because it no longer decides the report. What Document.Units actually
  reports is UNKNOWN too: setting a model writes a per file override, the same one the
  Units and Transform dialog shows, while what the scene is measured and displayed in is
  an application option, Options, Interface, Display Units, which Autodesk documents as
  what tolerances for clash detection are set in. Whether Document.Units reads that option
  is not readable off the DLL, so it is not claimed. The words DID NOT FOLLOW are gone from
  the log. The combo on the Outputs step is MODEL units, defaulting to Meters, and its help
  line says the report is always in metres
- A tick box has to earn being a decision. Fifteen went to eleven, of which ONE is visible
  without opening anything. Republishing the NWD, writing the client page and rendering the
  photos are fixed ON, because a weekly run wants all three every time. Client columns only
  is gone outright, dead since the workbook became one sheet with none of ours on it.
  Dating the NWD, the clash XML, the thumbnails and the five image status boxes are
  collapsed under More, rarely changed. The two that destroy data are collapsed on their
  own under Things that destroy data, because they do not belong beside ordinary output
  options. Fewer decisions is the goal, not more words explaining them

## What a tick box says

A tick box is a SHORT LABEL and one grey line under it. Bader called the long ones a
nightmare and he was right: they ran off the edge of the window, they shouted in capitals,
and they explained the off state as well as the on state, so nothing stood out.

- the label is at most EIGHT words and names the thing, not the mechanism
- one grey help line under it, at most TWELVE words, saying what it costs
- no capitals for emphasis anywhere. Acronyms a person says out loud are fine
- do not describe the off state unless it changes what someone would choose
- the two that destroy something carry a red exclamation mark beside the label. A mark,
  because when every label shouted, none of them did

The numbers in a help line are measured, never estimated. Photos are about 0.08 seconds
each and 213 took 17 seconds. Pasting them takes the workbook from 0.3 MB to 52 MB.

There were fifteen and there are eleven, of which ONE is visible without opening anything.
A box only stays if a normal weekly run genuinely has to choose. Everything else became a
fixed behaviour with the sensible answer chosen, or moved under an expander. The two that
destroy data are under one of their own, because they do not belong beside ordinary output
options. Which box went where and what each removed one was fixed to is in docs\history\scan.md 4q.

tools\probes\probe-window-labels.ps1 reads every tick box out of the real window and checks all
of this, so the limits are proved rather than remembered. It OPENS every expander first,
because a collapsed one has no visual tree behind it and the probe found one box and
reported no problems, and it says how many are visible without opening anything, which is
the number the window is judged on.
