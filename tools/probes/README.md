# Probes

Eleven PowerShell scripts that read facts off the machine they run on: the installed
Navisworks DLLs, and the real window once the add-in is built and installed. They were
how docs/history/scan.md was measured. Nothing here is part of the build or the install.

Every probe takes the Navisworks install folder as a parameter, defaulting to the same
folder the add-in project defaults to:

    powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\probes\probe-units.ps1
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\probes\probe-units.ps1 -NavisworksPath "D:\Autodesk\Navisworks Manage 2025"

The eight DLL probes need only the install:

- `probe-clash-api.ps1` reads every type and member of Autodesk.Navisworks.Clash.dll,
  which is how the copy forms, the eEXTERNAL ownership and the absence of any stale
  marker were measured
- `probe-clash-images.ps1` reads the members that render a clash picture
- `probe-units.ps1` reads which members can set a document's or a model's units, which
  is how DocumentModels.SetModelUnitsAndTransform was found to be the only one
- `probe-model-remove.ps1` answers F50: whether one model can be taken out of an open
  document without clearing the whole thing. Nothing named Remove, Delete or Detach
  against a model had ever been read off the DLL, so it was UNKNOWN rather than absent.
  See docs/history/scan.md section 5a
- `probe-viewpoints.ps1` answers F52: how a saved viewpoint folder is made, how a
  viewpoint goes in it, whether a name can be set and what has to be disposed. The repo
  had never touched DocumentSavedViewpoints and nothing about it was measured. It prints
  DocumentSelectionSets beside it, because the sets tree is the closest shape this tool
  already builds. See docs/history/scan.md section 5b
- `probe-document-ready.ps1` answers 5e for F74: whether anything on the API says an
  opened document has finished loading. Every member of Document, DocumentModels and
  Application whose name holds Load, Ready, Busy, Progress, State, Pending or Complete,
  and every event on each. See docs/history/scan.md section 5e

The three window probes need the add-in built in Release and installed by
build\install.ps1, because they construct the real window:

- `probe-window-defaults.ps1` prints every box's text and state, which is how blank
  naming boxes were caught
- `probe-window-labels.ps1` reads every tick box and checks its label and help line
  against the word limits in CLAUDE.md, opening every expander first. Takes
  -maxLabelWords and -maxHelpWords as well
- `probe-window-scroll.ps1` measures each step against the height it gets, so which
  steps need a scrollbar is read rather than guessed. Takes -w and -h as well

A probe that cannot find what it needs says UNKNOWN and the path it looked at, and
stops. Never search the install folder for a DLL, the path is built and tested directly,
which is the same rule the build uses.
